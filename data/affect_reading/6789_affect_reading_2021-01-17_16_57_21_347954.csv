Whether a program of research will 'pay off' by casting new light on some difficult problem or perplexing aspect of behavior will also depend on the quality of the scientist's research ideas, or hypotheses. The scientist views facts not as isolated or separate entities or events, but as meaningfully connected. The scientist's hypotheses are the starting points for approaching this sort of connectedness, by making a theoretical guess as to the significance or meaning of a given fact.

Extensive preparation is crucial. The literature should be carefully reviewed, and the task should be thought about at length. One must select the most fundamental elements that will constitute the crux of the hypotheses. A classic principle of this intellectual ruminative and winnowing process is known as Occam's razor, named after the philosopher William of Occam. The principle of Occam's razor, also called the principle of parsimony, teaches that hypotheses introduced to explain relationships should be as parsimonious as possible. We 'cut away' what is superfluous. Occam's razor is a qualified demand for prudence so that we do not overcomplicate the search for truth.

The rumors, he reasoned, gave the survivors something to be frightened about. This was reassuring for them in a way!

Those who skipped a night of sleep to study for a test were found to achieve lower grades than those who did not stay up.
