FINGER TAPPING TASK
You will be asked to tap your right index finger on the index finger button on the response box.
Try to match your tapping rate to the flashing circle cue displayed in the center of the screen.
When the circle stops flashing, please focus on the cross (+) in the center of the screen and wait for the circle to begin flashing again.
