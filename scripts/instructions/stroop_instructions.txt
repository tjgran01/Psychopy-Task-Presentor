Color Reading Task
In this task you will be asked to read a series of words, one at a time, displayed in the center of the screen.
The words will be written in various colors: RED, BLUE, and GREEN.
Your goal is to respond by pressing the arrow key corresponding to the word that is written, not the color the word is presented in.
To input a response of "Red" -> Press the LEFT Arrow key on the keyboard. To input a response of "Green" -> Press the DOWN arrow key on the keyboard. To input a response of "Blue" -> Press the RIGHT arrow key on the keyboard.
After you submit a response you will see a '+' displayed in the center of the screen for a period of time. Please focus your gaze on this point until the next word appears.
If you have any questions at this time, please alert the experimenter. Otherwise, the task will begin once you press the SPACEBAR.
