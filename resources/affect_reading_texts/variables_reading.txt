College students who have examinations the subsequent day might pull an 'all-nighter' in which they sacrifice sleep for one complete night of exam preparation. A study measured the sleep habits of 111 students to see if there was a correlation between getting regular sleep and student grades. Those who skipped a night of sleep to study for a test were found to achieve lower grades than those who did not stay up. It may seem that the conclusion from this study is that 'pulling an all-nighter' will cause students to attain low grades, however that constitutes a common scientific mistake.
The mistake was to erroneously interpret the results as demonstrating cause and effect. Unfortunately for the prospects of testing causal claims about sleep deprivation and exam performance, the original study used a quasi-experimental design, where no experimental manipulation was performed. The finding indicates that getting less sleep is correlated with getting lower grades yet does not support the claim that getting less sleep causes lower grades. Correlations can only lead to conclusions about the strength of relationships between variables: we cannot use correlation alone to infer the direction of influence between the variables.
