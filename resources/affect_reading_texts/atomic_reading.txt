Atomic energy is the energy that holds the nucleus of an atom together. The sun's energy is believed to originate from atomic reactions in which nuclei of helium are built up from nuclei of hydrogen. It has been found that the mass of an atomic nucleus is less than the total mass of the separate particles that make it up. The reason is that when a nucleus forms, part of the mass of the component particles is changed into energy, which is then radiated away. The quantity of energy released in reactions of this kind is almost inconceivably greater than the quantity released by any other type of reaction involving similar quantities of material.
Every second, the sun sends into space a million times as much energy as is stored in all our coal, petroleum, and natural gas fields. If we could duplicate the method by which this energy is released, we could revolutionize the world. And the possibility of doing just this is no more fantastic today than the concept of an atomic bomb was in 1900. The time may come when the hydrogen from a cubic mile of sea water will provide enough energy to satisfy our needs at the 1960 rate for 300 centuries.
