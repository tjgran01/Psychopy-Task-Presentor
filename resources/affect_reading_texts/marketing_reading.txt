Marketing is the performance of those business activities that direct the flow of good and services from producer to consumer or user. Marketing is the connecting link between the producer and the consumer or user. The marketing system brings production and consumption together. Approximately one in every six gainfully employed persons is engaged directly in wholesaling or retailing activities. This ratio does not take into account other persons who are serving marketing through transportation, communication, and office jobs. Marketing provides opportunities for many kinds of jobs requiring a wide range of skills and abilities.
Although we naturally think of selling as being the primary occupation in marketing, there are opportunities in management, advertising, market and product research, and buying. The economic well-being of our country is determined largely by productivity, consumption, and employment. The efficiency of the marketing process affects all three. If marketing stimulates demand, people will consume goods at a high rate. High consumption requires high productivity to meet the wants of people, and high productivity and high-level activity in marketing combined result in high employment. Indirectly, marketing is a key to a high level of economic living for the people.
