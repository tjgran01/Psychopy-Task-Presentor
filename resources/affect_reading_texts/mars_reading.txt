Even most skeptics, because they seem to share the hope that there is life on Mars, try hard not to discount the possibility. But it was a comedown in the mid-1960’s when scientists involved in the Mars exploration studied photos taken by some of the early Mariner space flights. No canals. No seas. No busy Martian engineers. No menacing warlike Martians as hugs as skyscrapers. Just mountains, craters, cold winds, and dust storms. It was almost as if scouts for Columbus had returned to Isabella’s court with the news that the world had turned out to be flat after all. 
Hopeful astronomers reminded us that the Mariner IV had photographed a mere one percent of the Martian surface from 2,000 miles away. And they pointed out that the Earth-orbiting Tiros weather satellite shot over 20,000 pictures before uncovering any evidence of life on Earth. But still, public enthusiasm for Martian exploration wilted. By the time Viking I touched down on the Plain of Chryse in August, few seemed to care at all. J. Richard Keefe, one of the Viking scientists, declared himself 'disgusted' at what he called the 'blasé…apathetic' public response and the skimpy television coverage of what was certainly one of the magnificent scientific and technical accomplishments in human history.
