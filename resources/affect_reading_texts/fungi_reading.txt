Fungi give cheese the flavor, odor, and character so highly prized by the gourmet. One such mold was first found in caves near the French village of Roquefort. Legend has it that a peasant boy left his lunch, a mild fresh piece of goat cheese, in one of these caves and on returning found it marbled, tart, and redolent. Only cheeses from the area around these particular caves are permitted to bear the name of Roquefort. As early as the seventeenth century, ergot, the fungus of rye, was used to facilitate childbirth. One of its effects is the contraction of the involuntary muscles, particularly of the uterus.
In the twentieth century, ergot has once more attracted interest as the source of the chemical from which the hallucinogenic drug LSD is derived. Most of the modern antibiotics are produced by fungi. The first of these was discovered by Alexander Fleming, who noted that a mold of the genus Penicillium which had contaminated a culture of staphylococcus growing on a nutrient agar plate had completely halted the growth of the bacteria. Antibiotics, of which many hundreds have now been discovered, are substances produced by a living organism that injure another living organism.
