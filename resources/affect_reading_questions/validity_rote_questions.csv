1	Construct Validity	Please select the best answer to the question.	What is construct validity?	Whether a test measures the intended phenomenon	Whether a construct is generalizable	Whether a measure is determined by experts to be valid	Whether a measure is predictive of other measures
2	Construct Validity	Please select the best answer to the question.	What does it mean if you design a measure of 'sensitivity to nonverbal cues' and then find that it correlates with an IQ test?	Performance on your measure could be due to a reason other than sensitivity to nonverbal cues	It means nonverbal communication is indistinguishable from other abilities	Your measure has high discriminant validity	It suggests the skill is too complicated to capture with a normal measure
3	External Validity	Please select the best answer to the question.	Why might a construct have poor internal validity?	Because there is another explanation for the relationship between the variables	Because it was studied in a specific population and might not apply to another population	Because it has only been observed in a laboratory	Because it has poor inferential validity
4	External Validity	Please select the best answer to the question.	Why is the use of volunteer participants a threat to external validity?	Because if you have volunteered you might be more compliant than you would be in real life	Because the type of people who volunteer for research studies are atypical	Because volunteer participants will say whatever they think the researcher wants to hear	Because researchers take advantage of volunteer participants
